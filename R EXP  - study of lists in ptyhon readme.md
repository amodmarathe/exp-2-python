Lists are a fundamental data structure in Python.A list in Python is used to store multiple items in a single variable. 
They are one of the 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data.
There are various commands in that we can use in list such as append wich is used to add items and remove which is used to remove items from the list.
Commands like exte3nd , max for maximum value min for minimum value,  len for lentgh of the list i.e numbver of items in the list.
Indexing in Python lists allows you to access individual elements or a range of elements.


 Algorithm - Student marks
 make a list named marks
 print it
 use max_marks for maximum marks
 min_marks for minimum marks
 len for number of students
 sum(marks)/len(marks) for avergae value
 use marks.sort for ascending order.

 Algorithm - GROCERY LIST
 make a grocery list with few items
 use append to add some more items
 use remove command to remove 2 items
 then print the final grocery list


conclusion - in this experiment we learnt about lists in python and various commands such as append,extend ,remove , max,min,sort,indexing
